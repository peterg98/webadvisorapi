# webadvisorapi
Unofficial API for University of Guam's WebAdvisor

This was originally created with the intent to provide a data store of all courses for another open source project, but unfortunately WebAdvisor makes it very difficult to scrape the data.

Created with Pyppeteer (a port of node.js' puppeteer to Python) and the Django web framework with Django REST framework. Hosted at https://uogwebadvisorapi.herokuapp.com/
